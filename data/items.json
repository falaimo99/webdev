Weta Workshop created this film prop with an intricate chainmail design, made from anodized aluminum to mimic the shimmering beauty and lightness described in the books.

The shirt was worn by Elijah Wood throughout the films and was crucial in multiple scenes—most notably in the Mines of Moria, where it prevented a fatal blow. The shirt later served as a powerful symbol of Frodo’s role in the story when it was displayed by the Orcs in Mordor as false proof of his death."

			"long": "The Mithril shirt is a prime example of how Peter Jackson’s adaptation sought authenticity in its props. Crafted by Weta Workshop, the shirt was made using thousands of interlinked anodized aluminum rings, reflecting the luminous silver sheen described inThe Lord of the Rings. In Tolkien’s legendarium, Mithril was mined only in Moria and was a symbol of lost greatness—its presence in Frodo’s possession connected him to Middle-earth’s rich history. In the films, its cinematic significance extends beyond mere costume design, visually representing Frodo’s hidden resilience and the unseen forces protecting him on his journey."
