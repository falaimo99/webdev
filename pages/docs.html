                Users that are experts in the domain (in our case the so called
                «Tolkien Scholars») or users that want a deep dive and have some
                time to spend for the exhibit.
            </li>
        </ul>

            The functionality allowing users to adjust the length and complexity
            of the text for each exhibit across three levels per axis will be
            discussed in detail later. For now, it's important to understand
            that this feature allows for tailored information delivery.

        <p>
            This led us to work on a small description and metadata database
            described in JSON, for a total of 9 descriptions per exhibit.

        <h3 id="231-frontend-technologies">2.3.1 Frontend Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            The Website makes use of the &quot;traditional&quot; frontend stack,
            (HTML, CSS, JS). It tends to adopt a modular approach, that
            separates html pages, style and scripts on different files.
        </p>
        <h3 id="232-backend-technologies">2.3.2 Backend Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            The requirements of the project don't comprehend a backend part
            development, the only &quot;backend&quot; part is assolved by the
            hosting system.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only other consideration about backend is about internal data
            retrieval, the Project make use of an items.json file to retrieve
            the informational content to display for the exhibition.

            3.1 Website Structure and Navigation

        <p>
            The website structure is fairly simple having only one job in mind.
            Navigation is facilitated by the presence of recognizable buttons
            and an attempt to respect visual hyerarchy among the elements at
            screen.

        <p>
            Starting from the index/homepage it is possible to visit one of the
            informational pages (about, docs), and an highlighted access to the
            main feature of the website, &quot;The Map&quot; page, from which
            you can start exploring the collection.

            The pages are few enough to make it available for us to devise
            unique designs for each of them. Trying to retain a coherent
            aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>Consistent templates are present in:</p>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="321-homepage">3.2.1 Homepage</h3>
        <p>
            The index/homepage is strongly inspired by The British Museum one,
            being this imaginary exhibition staged inside &quot;The King's
            Library&quot;, the first series of rooms indexed in the
            <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/visit/museum-map"
                >Official Map</a
            >
            of the aforementioned museum.
        </p>
        <p>The homepage features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A pitch black header bar containing the links to the
                informational pages (about, docs)
            </li>
            <li>
                A background video that merges real life Tolkien artifacts and
                clips with movies clips from «The Lord Of The Rings» Trilogy, it
                was realized using the open source video editor
                <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">kdenlive</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                A small tooltip box containing some informative text about the
                exhibition and a slightly bigger button leading to &quot;The
                Map&quot; the main feature of the website.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The differences with the British Museum website are to be found in
            layout, we have of course fewer elements to deal with; and
            overflowing, we decided to have a static full-viewport homepage,
            while the BM site has to include many more elements below their bar
            and background video.
        </p>
        <h3 id="322-%22the-map%22-page">3.2.2 &quot;The Map&quot; Page</h3>
        <p>
            This is the page that guides the user through the exhibition, this
            is a graph representation of the user interaction, this acts as a
            &quot;setup phase&quot; that allows the user how they want to visit
            and the difficulty of the descriptions. During this phase the user
            is presented with two <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> elements.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-mermaid"><div class="mermaid">flowchart LR

            >
        </p>
        <p>
            After the setup phase the user is able to explore the map in
            different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                if they selected a Path, the map will zoom and pan to focus on
                the museum section dedicated to it, highlighted with the theme
                colour of that path. It will then appear a &quot;Start
                Journey&quot; button that will guide you through the right order
                of appearance of the exhibits.
            </li>
            <li>
                if they selected free roam they can freely explore each and
                every item available without an order.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A useful &quot;Resume Journey&quot; button will substitute the
            &quot;Start Journey&quot; one, and will make it possible to resume
            from the last item you selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every Journey consists only of the selected items in that zone and
            will automatically reach an end when you get to the last one
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides the map are available two buttons, one to return back to the
            homepage and another to visualize the british museum map, and a link
            that leads the user to the original source, in this view is also
            highlighted the actual exhibition location.
        </p>
        <h4 id="map-svg">Map Svg</h4>
        <p>
            The process to realize the svg that allows the map to function was
            rather simple but required some work and refinements, the map was
            traced using the official map provided by the British Museum, at
            first using <a href="https://www.figma.com">figma</a> and then
            refined using <a href="https://www.inkscape.com">inkscape</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is implemented using the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element in
            html, and it was used to simplify the interaction scripts at work
            that will be later described.
        </p>
        <h3 id="323-item-card">3.2.3 Item Card</h3>
        <p>
            Each exhibit card follows the same template. The first set of
            information at display is the museal description of the item,
            adjustable per level and length through radio buttons. You can also
            access, with dedicated buttons, the available metadata and map for
            each item. The map is retrieved using
            <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> and
            <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In each card you can also find arrows to move from one item to the
            other without using the map to select each one of them.
        </p>
        <h3 id="324-informational-pages-about-docs">
            3.2.4 Informational Pages (About, Docs)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Informational page give access to the relevant information for
            those interested in the project and its developers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;About&quot; provides a small overview of the team and
                links to their github profiles
            </li>
            <li>
                &quot;Docs&quot; provides technical documentation, and licensing
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="33-javascript-functionality">3.3 JavaScript Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            All the relevant javascript code is contained into
            <code>scripts/script.js</code>, being all the pages except &quot;The
            Map&quot; page static it is relevant only for the functionalities
            described in paragraph 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Javascript is used for all the interactive functionality on the
            website, everything is managed client side. The script loads content
            coming from <code>data/items.json</code>, and adjusts it according
            to the choices made by the user during the setup phase. Javascript
            is also used to set the variables during the setup phase and to make
            them available throughout the session.
        </p>
        <p>
            The functions provided regulate the behavior of the setup dialogs,
            of the British Museum Map dialog, and the item card content
            retrieval and displaying.
        </p>
        <h3 id="34-styling-and-theming-css">3.4 Styling and Theming (CSS)</h3>
        <p>
            The Styling and Theming is full of small references to Tolkien's
            work. We'll try to outline them in this paragraph, it is a simple
            theming but we deem effective enough to please the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned before the theme chosen for the homepage traces back to
            the British Museum Homepage, but we decided to add our own video
            background, selecting and intertwining real life clips of Tolkien
            and scenes from the movie, this is intended to create a visual
            reference to our two paths, the origin and the legacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The map contains a total different approach, we decided to adopt a
            colorful and yet simple style for it.
        </p>
        <p>The main colors hint to Tolkien's world and life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Gold for the legacy path, referring to the color of the ring.
            </li>
            <li>
                Green for the origin path, Tolkien was notoriously fond of trees
                and nature, he included lots of descriptions of the natural
                world in his works.
            </li>
            <li>
                Skyblue for some details, it is a color that is recurrent in
                important and mysterious characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lighter bronze-brown, provides a good and pleasing base color
                for buttons, being close to the background dominating color.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The buttons are highlighted when hovered on and are rounded and
            solid, this creates a more modern look.
        </p>
        <p>
            The map style is simple and vectorial, tuned for readability and to
            provide good contrast between background, map borders and items at
            display.
        </p>
        <p>
            The background is the map of Middle Earth itself, blurred enough to
            avoid distraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the &quot;Adventurers&quot; setup and the about page there are
            images from the film, to provide a sort of early 2000s reminiscence,
            when magazines, scrapbooks and archaic html websites were popular.
        </p>
        <h2 id="data-management">Data Management</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier in this documentation the data for the items is
            provided via <code>json</code>, the data is still sparse and need to
            be cleared yet. We tried to provide a basic structure for the item
            cards and a small set of metadata information but it was truly a
            challenge to keep it consistent.
        </p>
        <h3 id="41-json-guidelines">4.1 JSON Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
            The data schema can be easily adopted as is, and can be reproduced
            for other use cases. A further development could be redacting an
            effective JSON schema.
        </p>
        <p>Every Item is described using the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An identfier,</li>
            <li>An h1 and an h2 to show in the main view of the card</li>
            <li>An image reference, it can be a link or a static local file</li>
            <li>
                Various metadata descriptors coming mainly from
                <a href="https://www.schema.org">schema</a> and
                <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Including, when available, relevant geographical
                        coordinates
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The nine descriptions that permit to adjust level and length,
                they were generated using an LLM providing the adequate (usually
                not much) context and then proofread.

            The biggest challenge was probably the unexpected strict and
            protective stance that The Tolkien Estate took towards any
            trademark, copyright and product slightly related to Tolkien and his
            imaginarium. It was difficult even to find the correct links to the
            images displayed in the imaginary exhibit and to gather the few
            available metadata for each time. The reason is probably related to
            how popular and dear this world is, making it perfectly sustainable
            to avoid any sort of information leak or sharing.

        <h3 id="c-future-developments">C. Future Developments</h3>
        <p>Future developments could involve:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a better and more thorough research of material and related
                metadata, possibly encased in a reusable schema.
            </li>
            <li>
                a better integration of styling and design purposes, to make the
                overall look even more coherent
            </li>
            <li>
                devise similar exhibitions about different subjects to test the
                model and the workflow
            </li>
        </ul>
