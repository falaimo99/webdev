Okay, here's a comprehensive index outline you can use as a reference for your technical documentation for a museum exhibition website. This outline covers various aspects, from the overall architecture to specific functionalities and maintenance.

## Introduction

The Middle Earth Cabinet is a Project Website following the guidelines for the 2024-2025 a.y. valid for the exam "Information Modeling and Web Technologies".

### 1.1 Purpose of this Document

This document has the purpose of providing a complete documentation of the work done. It urges to be comprehensive and extensive, describing every individual aspect of the website itself.

### 1.2 Audience

The selected audience for this website is, by design, diverse and the website itself is built to give to each and every user the tools to enforce this flexibility.

The three main groups described by the requirements include:

-   Elementary and Middle School kids.
-   Average museum visitors with different available time for the visit.
-   Users that are experts in the domain (in our case the so called «Tolkien Scholars») or users that want a deep dive and have some time to spend for the exhibit.

The functionality allowing users to adjust the length and complexity of the text for each exhibit across three levels per axis will be discussed in detail later. For now, it's important to understand that this feature allows for tailored information delivery.

This led us to work on a small description and metadata database described in JSON, for a total of 9 descriptions per exhibit.

### 1.3 Scope of the Website

This Website serves as an online guide and tour for the imaginary exhibition «The Middle Earth Cabinet». The Scope of the Website is therefore to provide the adequate informational content tailored for the target audience and presented in a streamlined and intuitive way, but also to be informative about the location of the exhibit and transparent about the curators.

### 1.4 Document Conventions

The terminology of the documentation will make use of technical jargon and it will refer to common practices in a familiar way, confident that those who read it are knowledgeable enough to understand it.

## Website Overview and Architecture

### 2.1 Website Goals and Objectives

As mentioned before the goal is to obtain an easy to use and intuitive system that can be easily reproduced for a different exhibition. It tries to be compliant with the exam requirements and adds some facilities where needed to support its goals.

### Hosting

«The Middle Earth Cabinet» is hosted making use of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), starting from a [repository](https://github.com/falaimo99/webdev) hosted on one of the curators and developers [github account](https://github.com/falaimo99).

### 2.2.1 Frontend Technologies

The Website makes use of the "traditional" frontend stack, (HTML, CSS, JS). It tends to adopt a modular approach, that separates html pages, style and scripts on different files.

### 2.2.2 Backend Technologies

The requirements of the project don't comprehend a backend part development, the only "backend" part is assolved by the hosting system.

The only other consideration about backend is about internal data retrieval, the Project make use of an items.json file to retrieve the informational content to display for the exhibition.
